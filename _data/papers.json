    "description": "Crater Observing Bio-inspired Rolling Articulator (COBRA) is a modular, snake-inspired robot that addresses the mobility challenges of extraterrestrial exploration sites such as Shackleton Crater. Incorporating snake-like gaits and tumbling locomotion, COBRA navigates both uneven surfaces and steep crater walls. We present the robot's design, dynamic modeling, high-fidelity simulations, and field validation demonstrating its multi-modal capabilities.",

    "description": "Rough terrain locomotion has remained one of the most challenging mobility questions. In 2022, NASA's Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) Program invited US academic institutions to participate NASA's Breakthrough, Innovative & Game-changing (BIG) Idea competition by proposing novel mobility systems that can negotiate extremely rough terrain, lunar bumpy craters. In this competition, Northeastern University won NASA's top Artemis Award award by proposing an articulated robot tumbler called COBRA (Crater Observing Bio-inspired Rolling Articulator). This report briefly explains the underlying principles that made COBRA successful in competing with other concepts ranging from cable-driven to multi-legged designs from six other participating US institutions.",
